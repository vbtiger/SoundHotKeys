	<b>My first ever project on GitHub.</b>
</p>
<p>
	I made this peace of application many years ago and used it now to start my GitHub account.

	<b>About the app: </b>

You can set paths to wav files and set (almost) any keyboard hotkey to it. 
<br>
If you press it, the wav will play, anywhere, anytime, always.
